# Urban Dynamics of Chicago 

In this project, we delve into the complex interplay
between various urban dynamics, including crime rates, rental
and housing prices, traffic crashes, healthcare inspections, and
cab fares. We observe correlations between these diverse datasets,
aiming to uncover patterns and relationships. We also leverage
data visualization techniques to aid with the presentation of our
findings so that they can help people make data backed decisions.
